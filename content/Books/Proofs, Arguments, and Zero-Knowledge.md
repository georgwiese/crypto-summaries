## Chapter 1: Introduction
- Definitions:
	- **Verifiable Computing (VC)** and **Interactive Proofs (IP)**: enable a prover to provide a guarantee to a verifier that the prover performed a requested computation correctly
	- **Arguments** of Knowledge: Allows for false proofs if they require exorbitant computational power to find
	- **Zero Knowledge**: Proof reveals nothing but the validity of the statement
## Chapter 2: The Power of Randomness: Fingerprinting and Freivaldsâ€™ Algorithm
- **Reed-Solomon Fingerprinting**:
	- **Setting**: Alice and Bob want to check whether they have the same file
	- **Protocol**: Both parties compute a *fingerprint* and check whether it is the identical
	- **Reed-Solomon Encoding**: For some prime $p < n^2$, interpret the file as messages in $\mathbb{F}^n_p$ and consider the family of hash functions: $h_r(a_1, ..., a_n) = \sum^{n}_{i = 1}a_i \cdot r^{i - 1}$ for $r \in \mathbb{F}_p$
	- -> Collision resistant because to unequal polynomials of degree $d$ can only agree on $d$ points
- **Freivald's algorithm**:
	- **Setting**: Given two matrices $A$ and $B$ of size $n^2$, compute $C = AB$. The fastest known algorithm is $O(n^{2.37286})$, but it is possible to *verify* that $C$ is computed correctly in time $O(n^2)$
	- Let $x = (1, r, r^2, ..., r^{n - 1})$, compute $y = Cx$ and $z = A \cdot Bx$, accept if they are equal
	- -> Each entry in the the vectors are Reed-Solomon fingerprints of a row of $C$ and $(AB)$, respectively
- **Univariate Lagrange interpolation**: See [[Low Degree and Multilinear Extensions]]
- **Evaluating** $q_a(r)$: All values $\delta_j(r)$ can be evaluated in $O(n)$ operations in total, by starting with $\delta_0(r)$ and computing $\delta_i(r)$ from $\delta_{i - 1}(r)$ (which has almost the same terms) in constant time
	- -> Total time to evaluate is $O(n)$
## Chapter 3: Definitions and Technical Preliminaries
- **Interactive Proof System (IP)**:
	- Probabilistic verifier and deterministic prover which are "next-message passing algorithms"
	- Both parties are given $x \in \{0, 1\}^n$; at the beginning, the prover provides a value claimed to equal $f(x)$ 
	- $t := (m_1, m_2, ..., m_k)$ is called the **transcript**
	- $out(V, x, r, P) \in \{0, 1\}$ is the deterministic output of $V$ given its randomness $r$, input $x$ and prover strategy $P$
	- An IP is **valid** if it is **sound** and **complete**
- **Argument systems**: An IP for which soundness is only required to hold against prover strategies that run in polynomial time

## Chapter 4: Interactive Proofs
- [[Multivariate Sum-Check Protocol]]
- **Application of the Sum-Check protocol to \#SAT**:
	- **Boolean formula**: A boolean circuit with fan-out of 1 for all non-output gates
	- **Goal**: Given a boolean formula $\phi$, compute $\sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^n} \phi(x)$, i.e., the number of inputs for which $\phi$ outputs $1$
	- -> Fastest known algorithm needs exponential time!
	- **Approach**: Turn $\phi$ into an **arithmetic circuit** over $\mathbb{F}$ by replacing $AND(x, y)$ gates by $x \cdot y$, $OR(x, y)$ by $x + y - x \cdot y$, etc.; then apply the sum-check protocol to this multivariate polynomial
- **A simple IP for Counting Triangles in Graphs**:
	- Given an adjacency matrix $A$ for a given graph, the number of triangles can be computed as $\Delta = \frac{1}{6} sum(A^3)$
	- For any given $A$, there is a function $f_A: \{0, 1\}^{\log n} \times \{0, 1\}^{\log n} \rightarrow \{0, 1\}$ that takes the binary representations of row and column indices and outputs the entry of the matrix at that position
	- Therefore, $\Delta = \frac{1}{6} \sum_{x, y, z \in \{0, 1\}^{\log n}} f_A(x, y) \cdot f_A(y, z) \cdot f_A(x, z)$
	- -> Can apply the sum-check protocol to $g(X, Y, Z) = \tilde{f_A}(X, Y) \cdot \tilde{f_A}(Y, Z) \cdot \tilde{f_A}(X, Z)$

## Chapter 5: Publicly Verifiable, Non-interactive Arguments via Fiat-Shamir
- **Random Oracle Model (ROM)**: Prover and verifier have access to some random function
	- Does not exist in practice: A random function would have to be represented by a function table which would be huge for cryptographic security levels
	- In practice, no deployed system has been broken because of this
- **Fiat-Shamir Transformation**: Verifier message in round $i$ is the evaluation of a *cryptographic* hash function quere the query point is the list of messages sent by the prover in rounds $1, ..., i$![[fiat_shamir.png]]
	- Secure in the ROM on *constant-round* public coin IPs where the prover has to run in polynomial time
	- Hash chaining: To save on the cost of hashing, one can also use $r_i := h(x, i, r_{i - 1}, g_i)$
	- If the prover can choose $x$ (e.g. the input to the circuit proved by the [[GKR]] protocol) freely, it is *essential* that $x$ is part of the transcript
- **Correlation-intractability (CI)**: A hash family satisfies CI on some property if it is computationally infeasible to find a pair $(y, h(y)$ that satisfies the property
	- There are hash families for various classes of IPs & arguments, with the CI property holding under standard cryptographic assumptions, but they are very expensive and hence impractical
## Chapter 6: Front Ends: Turning Computer Programs Into Circuits
- **Front end**: Program -to-circuit compiler
- **Back end**: The argument system
- Goal: turn arbitrary programs running on a **Random Access Machine (RAM)** (memory + registers + instructions + PC) in $T$ steps into arithmetic circuits
- Preliminary techniques:
	- **Evaluate step-by-step**: In each layer, list the *entire machine configuration* (e.g. representing each memory cell as 64 binary field elements) and repeatedly apply a sub-circuit that performs one computations step
		- Unusable in the context of GKR, because the number of layers (and hence verifier time) is $\Theta(T)$
		- Massive circuit, because each memory cell is repeated in each step
	- **Turning small-space programs into shallow circuits**: If the program uses little space the *configuration graph* is small and can be represented using an adjacency matrix. Running the machine for $n$ steps is equivalent to squaring the matrix $\log n$ times.
- **Circuit satisfiability problem**: There *exists* a witness $w$ such that $C(x, w) = y$
	- This is in contrast to the *circuit evaluation problem* where we show that $C(x) = y$
- **Transcript** or **trace**: The list of *changes* to the machine configuration in each time step, of size $O(T)$
	- If a memory operation happened, contains a memory location & value
- **Transformation from computer programs to arithmetic circuit satisfiability**: The circuit takes the transcript as witness and checks two properties:
	- **Memory consistency**: When a value is read, it needs to return the most recently written value to that location
	- **Time consistency**: Assuming memory consistency holds, check that the transition from step $i$ to $i + 1$ was correct
- **Checking for time consistency**:
	- Can be done in parallel!
	- Example: Implementing $a > b$ ($a, b \in \mathbb{F}_p$, $l := \lceil\log p\rceil$)
		- Add $2l$ witness values $a_0, ..., a_{l - 1}, b_0, ..., b_{l - 1}$ representing the bit representations of $a$ and $b$
		- Add output gates that compute $a_i^2 - a_i$ -> 0 iff. all $a_i$ are binary
		- Add output gate that computes $a - \sum_{i = 0}^la_i2^i$ -> 0 iff. binary decomposition is correct
			- **Error**: I don't think that's sound, the sum could overflow the field
		- For $j = l - 2, l - 3, ..., 1$, define:
			- $A_j := \prod_{j'> j}(a_{j'} b_{j'} + (1 - a_{j'})(1 - b_{j'}))$
				- -> $1$ iff. the $l - j$ most significant bits are equal
		- The following expression equal $1$ iff. $a > b$:
		  $a_{l - 1} (1 - b_{l - 1} + A_{l-2}a_{l - 2} (1 - b_{l -2}) + ... + A_0 a_0 (1 - b_0)$
- **Checking for memory consistency**:
	- Idea: Sort memory accesses by (address, time), then consistency can be checked by putting constraints on neighboring items
	- **Routing Networks**: A graph of depth $O(\log T)$ that allows the prover to permute the memory accesses in any order, using additional witness values
	- Optimizations if we allow for witnesses to false statements, but that are hard to find:
		- **Memory Consistency via Merkle Trees**: Every read is followed by a Merkle proof, which is validated by the circuit
			- -> Lots of hashes, but efficient if there are few memory operations
		- Adapt [[Offline Memory Checking]]
- **Efficiently representing non-arithmetic operations over large prime-order fields**:
	- Bootle et al. (2018, Arya):
		- Instead of bit-decomposing elements, use base $b = 2^{W/c}$ where $W$ is the word size and $c$ is a constant
		- The range-check happens via the following lookup argument:
			- To show: values $\{f_1, ..., f_N\}$ are all contained in $\{s_1, ..., s_B\}$
			- -> There are non-negative integers $e_1, ..., e_B$ such that the following polynomials are equal:
			  $h(X) := \prod_{i = 1}^N(X - f_i)$ and $q(X) := \prod_{i = 1}^B(X - s_i)^{e_i}$
			- The witness contains the bit representations of each $e_i \in \{0, 1\}^{\log_2N}$, and an arithmetic circuit of $O(B \log N)$ gates computes for a challenge point $r$:
			  $\prod_{i = 1}^B\prod_{j = 1}^{\log_2N}(r - s_i)^{2^j \cdot e_{i, j}}$ 
	- Gabizon & Williamson (2020, Plookup):
		- Simplified variant due to Cairo: All elements appear at least once and the lookup table covers a contiguous interval
		- Witness sequence $\{w_1, ..., w_n\}$ is claimed to equal $\{f_1, ..., f_N\}$ in sorted order
		- To show:
			- $\{w_1, ..., w_n\}$ is a permutation of $\{f_1, ..., f_N\}$
				- -> [[Permutation Check via Product Check]]
			- $s1 = w_1 \le w_2 \le ... \le w_N = s_B$
				-  Circuit checks $s1 = w_1$, $w_N = s_B$, and for each $i = 2, ..., N$:
				  $(w_i - w_{i - 1}) \cdot (w_i - (w_{i - 1} + 1)) = 0$
## Chapter 7: A First Succinct Argument for Circuit Satisfiability, from Interactive Proofs
- Idea: Instead of sending the witness to the verifier (which might be $\Theta(T)$), use a **polynomial commitment scheme (PCS)** to commit to $\widetilde{w}$
	- If $z$ is the concatenation of $x$ and $w$ (both of the same length, a power of $2$), it's multilinear extension is:
	  $\widetilde{z}(r_0, ..., r_{\log n}) = (1 - r_0) \cdot \widetilde{x}(r_1, ..., r_{\log n}) + r_0 \cdot \widetilde{w}(r_1, ..., r_{\log n})$
-  **A First (Relaxed) Polynomial Commitment Scheme**:
	- Build a Merkle tree of all $\mathbb{F}^{\log n}$ evaluations of the polynomial
		- Impractical, but included for didactic reasons
	- Then, we have to run a **low-degree test** to make sure that the evaluations are *close* to those of a low-degree polynomial
	- Example: **point-versus-line test**
		- Request evaluations of a random line in $\mathbb{F}^m$ and make sure that it corresponds to a univariate polynomial of degree at most $m$
		- Repeat a few times to reduce the soundness error
- **Knowledge Soundness**: Establishes not only that there *exists* a satisfying witness, but that the prover *knows* it
	- Formally shown by proving the existence of an ***efficient* extractor**: A program that can repeatedly interact with the prover to extract a valid witness
	- Why efficient? Because if it is efficient, the prover could run it by simulating the interaction with itself to compute the witness, so we can assume (s)he knows it!
	- Knowledge Soundness is a stronger property than binding
## Chapter 8: MIPs and Succinct Arguments
- **Multi-prover interactive proof**: Instead of one prover, we have *multiple*, which are not allowed to communicate after the start of the protocol (otherwise, they could be simulated with just one prover)
	- In practice, they only use the second prover to model a PCS!
- Example: Run GKR, but with a PCS answering the final query on the multilinear extension of the witness!
- [[Spartan]]
## Chapter 9: PCPs and Succinct Arguments
- **Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP)**: The verifier has oracle access to a *static* proof of length $l$, where typically the verifier would query random parts of the proof
- Closely related to MIPs: Can be converted in both directions, but with considerable constant overhead
- Can be compiled to a succinct argument by having the prover *commit* to the proof (e.g. via a Merkle tree) and then answer the verifier queries
- **A First Polynomial Length PCP, From an MIP**: Basically Clover (see [[Spartan]]), but using a base larger than $2$ (to reduce variables), with the proof consisting of every possible query by the verifier -> Proof size is at least $O(S^3)$
- **A PCP of Quasilinear Length for Arithmetic Circuit Satisfiability**: Skipped
## Chapter 10: Interactive Oracle Proofs
- **Interactive Oracle Proof (IOP)**: An IP where each round is given query access to each prover "special" message -> Generalization of IP and PCP
- **Polynomial IOP**: Special messages specify polynomials, the verifier can query evaluations
- **A polynomial IOP for R1CS-SAT via univariate sum-check**:
	- Setting: To show that $(Az) \circ (Bz) = Cz$, let $z_A = Az$, $z_B = Bz$, and $z_C = Cz$, and $\hat{z}_A$, $\hat{z}_B$, and $\hat{z}_C$ be their *unique univariate extensions* over a multiplicative subgroup $H \subseteq \mathbb{F}$ and show:
		- For all $h \in H$, $\hat{z}_A(h) \cdot \hat{z}_B(h) = \hat{z}_C(h)$
			- Run the [[Univariate Zero-Check Protocol]] on $\hat{z}_A(h) \cdot \hat{z}_B(h) - \hat{z}_C(h)$
		- For all $h \in H$ and $M \in \{A, B, C\}$, $\hat{z}_M(h) = \sum_{j \in H}M_{h, j} \cdot \hat{z}(j)$
			- Let $\hat{M}: H \times H \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ denote the *bivariate low-degree extension* of $M$
			- Because $\hat{z}_M$ is the *unique* extension, the following equality holds:
			  $\hat{z}_M(X) = \sum_{j \in H}\hat{M}(X, j)\hat{z}(j)$
			- The verifier checks this equality at a random point $r'$ by executing the [[Univariate Zero-Check Protocol]] asserting that $\sum_{j \in H}q(j) = 0$ for $q(Y) := \hat{M}(r', Y)\hat{z}(Y) - \hat{z}_M(r') \cdot |H|^{-1}$
			- As part of the protocol, the verifier has to evaluate $q(r'')$, which involves evaluating $\hat{M}(r', r'')$
			- This can be done by having a *trusted* party commit to $\hat{M}$ during pre-processing using a *holographic* commitment scheme, which means that the prover can reveal $\hat{M}(r', r'')$ in a time that's linear in the number of non-zero entries $k$ of $M$. Page 152 gives a holographic commitment scheme that involves committing to 3 univariate polynomials of degree $k$ (row, column, and value).
		- *Question: Does the prover really have to commit to and send the polynomials $\hat{z}_M$? Can't it work like in [[Spartan]] where the prover sends $\hat{z}_M(r')$ on demand which is then verified via the sum check?
- [[FRI]]
- **From univariate to multilinear polynomials**:
	- A multilinear polynomial is fully specified by its evaluations on the boolean hypercube, so we interpolate a *univariate* polynomial $Q$ that maps each element in $H$ to an evaluation at one of the hypercube points
	- To reveal $q(z) = v$, let $u_2$ be the polynomial that encodes the evaluation of all Lagrange basis polynomials at $z$
	- Then, it suffices to show that $\sum_{a \in H} Q(a) \cdot u_2(a) = v$
	- -> [[Univariate Sum-Check Protocol]]
	- At the end of the protocol, the verifier has to evaluate $u_2(r)$ for a random point $r \in \mathbb{F}$. This is only possible in linear time.
	- However, there is a layered circuit of size $O(n \log n)$ and depth $O(\log n)$, so [[GKR]] can be used to outsource the work to the prover
- [[Ligero and Brakedown Polynomial Commitments]]
## Chapter 11: Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Arguments
- **Zero Knowledge**: There exists a polynomial-time *simulator* algorithm that produces transcripts indistinguishable from those of a real interaction between a verifier & an *honest* prover
	- **Perfect zero-knowledge**: The distributions are identical
	- **Statistical zero-knowledge**: Negligible statistical distance
	- **Computational zero-knowledge**: No polynomial-time algorithm can distinguish the transcripts
	- **Honest verifier zero-knowledge**: Only real interactions with an *honest* count
- Why does the existence of a simulator not mean that the system is broken?
	- In fact, the simulator might even produce transcripts that "prove" false statements!
	- But: In a real proof, there is interaction. The simulator can already "know" later verifier messages when generating early prover messages.
- *I skipped the rest of the chapter!*
## Chapter 12: $\Sigma$-Protocols and Commitments from Hardness of Discrete Logarithm
- **Cryptographic background**:
	- **Group**: A set + an operation that behaves much like multiplication, i.e.:
		- **Closure**: $a, b \in \mathbb{G} \implies a \cdot b \in \mathbb{G}$
		- **Associativity**: $a \cdot (b \cdot c) = (a \cdot b) \cdot c$
		- **Identity**: There is an element $1_{\mathbb{G}}$ s.t. $1_{\mathbb{G}} \cdot g = g \cdot 1_{\mathbb{G}} = g$
		- **Invertibility**: For every $g \in \mathbb{G}$ there is a $h \in \mathbb{G}$ s.t. $g \cdot h = 1_{\mathbb{G}}$
		- **Commutativity?** (for *abelian* groups): $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$
	- The order of a *subgroup* always divides the order of the original group
	- Any prime-order subgroup is *cyclic* and any non-identity member is a *generator*
	- *Other concepts not summarized here: Discrete log problem, elliptic curve groups*
- [[Schnorr's Î£-Protocol for knowledge of discrete logarithm]]
- [[Pedersen Commitment]]
## Chapter 13: Zero-Knowledge via Commit-And-Prove and Masking Polynomials
- **Commit-and-prove**:
	- Setting: Let $C$ be an arithmetic circuit and let the prover make the claim that (s)he knows $w$ such that $C(w) = 1$
	- The prover sends a Pedersen commitment for each entry of $w$ and the *output of each multiplication gate*
	- Then, the prover proves knowledge of an opening to these comments
	- The verifier can on its own derive commitments to outputs of addition gates
	- For multiplication gates, the prover proves a product relationship between the committed values
- **zk-Arguments form IPs**:
	- Again, the prover sends Pedersen commitments to entires in $w$
	- Then, [[GKR]] is executed, but with the prover messages replaced with commitments
	- -> The verifier checks can be replaced with a commit-and-prove protocol using a circuit of size $O(d \log |C| + |w|)$
- **Zero-knowledge via masking polynomials**:
	- A zero-knowledge sum-check protocol:
		- Goal: Make the sum-check protocol applied to a polynomial $g$ zero-knowledge
		- Let the prover commit to a *random multi-linear polynomial* $p$
		- Let the prover send $P$ claimed to equal $\sum_{x \in \{0, 1\}^l}p(x)$
		- Let the verifier choose a random challenge $\rho$
		- -> Run the sum-check protocol on $g + \rho \cdot p$ (a random polynomial)
		- At the end of the protocol, the verifier queries $g(r)$
			- So, at this point, it's not perfectly zero-knowledge!
	- Mask $g(r)$: Replace $Z = \widetilde{W}$ with a slighly higher-degree extension of $W$
		1. Insist that the verifier challenges are from $\mathbb{F} \setminus \{0, 1\}$
		2. The prover picks $c_1$ and $c_2$ at random and choses:
		   $Z(X_1, \ldots, X_{\log s}) \coloneqq \widetilde{W}(X_1, \ldots, X_{\log s}) + c_1X_1(1 - X_1) + c_2X_2(1 - X_2)$
		3. Insist that the commitment scheme is zero-knowledge
		4. Apply the zk-variant of the sum-check protocol
## Chapter 14: Polynomial Commitments from Hardness of Discrete Logarithm
- **Polynomial commitment**: Allows a prover to commit to a polynomial and then later reveal the evaluation at points chosen by the verifier
	- Because the commitment is usually smaller than the polynomial, it can only be *computationally binding*
	- Evaluations proof can be shorter than evaluating the actual polynomial
	- They can be *zero-knowledge*, i.e., the verifier learns nothing about the polynomial except the evaluations
	- Often, polynomial commitment schemes are more general: They commit to a vector $u$ (e.g. the coefficients of the polynomial) and the prover to make a claim about $\langle c, u \rangle$ for some known vector $u$ (e.g. $y := (1, z, z^2, ..., z^{n - 1})$)
- [[Linear-size Pedersen Polynomial Commitment]]
- [[Generalized Pedersen Commitment]]
- [[Hyrax]]
- [[Bulletproofs]]
## Chapter 15: Polynomial Commitments from Pairings
- **Cryptographic Background**:
	- **Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption (DDH)**: Given a group, it is no feasible to distinguish $(g, g^a, g^b, g^{ab})$ and $(g, g^a, g^b, g^c)$, where $a, b, c$ are chosen randomly
		- -> Stronger than discrete log or computational Diffie-Helman (CDH, infeasible to compute $g^{ab}$ from $g^a$ and $g^b$)
	- **Bilinear map**: A map $e: \mathbb{G}_1 \times \mathbb{G}_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{G}_T$ such that $w(u^a, v^b) = e(u, v)^{a, b}$ (where $\mathbb{G}_T$ is called the *target group*)
		- $\mathbb{G}_1 = \mathbb{G}_2$ implies that DDH is false!
		- In practice, if $\mathbb{G}$ is an elliptic curve group defined over $\mathbb{F}_p$ then $\mathbb{G}_T$ is a subgroup of $\mathbb{F}_{p^k}$ where $k$ is called the *embedding degree* and equal to the smallest integer such that $|\mathbb{G}|$ divides $p^k - 1$
		- -> Embedding degree must be low for a curve to be *pairing friendly*
- [[KGZ]]
- [[Dory]]
## Chapter 16: Wrap-Up of Polynomial Commitments
- **Batch evaluation of homomorphically committed polynomials**:
	- Suppose a verifier wants to know both vaues $y_1 = p(r)$ and $y_2 = q(r)$
	- Instead of opening both commitments individually, the verifier can pick a random challenge $a$, compute the commitment to $a \cdot p + q$ and ask the prover to open this commitment at point $r$ to value $a \cdot y_1 + y_2$
- **Commitment scheme for sparse Polynomials** (sketch): A commitment scheme for *sparse* multilinear polynomials, using any commitment scheme for *dense* multilinear polynomials (proposed by Setty (2020))
	- **Idea**: Design a layered arithmetic circuit that takes a description $s$ of the $M$-sparse polynomial $q$ and $z \in \mathbb{F}^l$ and computes $q(z)$
	- The description $s$ is the list of:
		- $M$ coefficients
		- For each coefficient $c_i$, the *bits* $T_i \in \{0, 1\}^l$ of the Lagrange basis polynomial $\chi_{T_i} = \prod_{j = 1}^l (T_{i, j} X_j + (1 - T_{i, j})(1 - X_j))$ 
	- -> $O(Ml)$ gates, apply [[GKR]]
	- -> To reduce to $O(l)$, specify basis polynomials via a triple of integers and use a Random Access Machine (Chapter 6) to evaluate
- **Commitment schemes summary**:![[commitment_schemes.png]]
## Chapter 17: Linear PCPs and Succinct Arguments
- **Idea**: Super-polynomial PCPs are fine, if the prover does not have to *materialize* them
- **Linear PCP**: The proof is interpreted as a function $\pi: \mathbb{F}^v \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ for some integer $v$ (e.g. the circuit size $|S|$). The honest proof is the evaluation table of a *linear* function, i.e., $\pi(d_1q_1 + d_2q_2) = d_1\pi(q_1) + d_2\pi(q_2)$. Equivalently, $\pi$ is a **$v$-variate polynomial of total degree $1$ with a constant term of $0$**.
	- That means that just to specify a query point to the polynomial, the verifier has to specify $v$ field elements!
- [[Commitment to a Linear function]]
- **A first linear PCP for arithmetic circuit satisfiability**: Skipped, PCP has size $\mathbb{F}^{S + S^2}$
- [[GGPR]]
## Chapter 18: SNARK Composition and Recursion
- **Idea**: We can compose SNARKs, i.e., first compute a proof  of the *inner* SNARK (e.g. one with fast prover time, not necessarily zero-knowledge) and then compute an *outer* SNARK (e.g. one with low proof size / verification time, possibly zero-knowledge) that only claims to have validated the inner SNARK correctly
	- When composing a SNARK with itself repeatedly, one will eventually hit the **recursion threshold**, where the circuit size of the validating circuit does not decrease anymore.
	- Note that the knowledge extractor runtime grows *exponentially* with the recursion depth. So, for super-constant recursion depth, we don't know how to prove knowledge soundness!
- **Cycle of Curves**: In order to efficiently validate a SNARK using an elliptic curve group, we need a second curve whose *scalar field* is equal to the original curve's *base field*. With a cycle of curves (e.g. the Pasta curves), we can recurse infinitely.
- **Applications**:
	- Incremental computation: e.g. *Verifiable delay functions*
	- Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC)
	- Proof aggregation
