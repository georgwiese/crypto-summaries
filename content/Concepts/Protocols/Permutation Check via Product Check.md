Or equivalently: Prove equality of two multi-sets

Given two length-$m$ lists $a = (a_1, ..., a_m)$ and $b = (b_1, ..., b_m)$, we define:
$$
p_a(x) := \prod_{i = 1}^m(a_i - x)
$$
and
$$
p_b(x) := \prod_{i = 1}^m(b_i - x)
$$
These are equal if and only if $a$ and $b$ are permutations of each other. Equality of polynomials can be checked at a random point due to the [[Schwartz-Zippel Lemma]].
